# Problem Statement  
Students struggle to locate books efficiently in the library due to inadequate search tools. They often forget to renew or return books on time, leading to fines and financial strain. The manual processes lack automated reminders, increasing the likelihood of missed deadlines. This results in unnecessary penalties and disrupts their academic activities. An improved system is needed to streamline book search, renewal, and return processes.

It will offer real-time book availability updates, intuitive search functionalities, and automated notifications for renewals and returns.
